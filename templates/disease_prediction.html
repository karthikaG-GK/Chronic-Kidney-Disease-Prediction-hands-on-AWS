Food tips:
</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>
        <font face="Comic Sans">
        Eat less salt/sodium. That's a good move for diabetes and really important for CKD. Over time, your kidneys lose 
        the ability to control your sodium-water balance. Less sodium in your diet will help lower blood pressure and 
        decrease fluid buildup in your body, which is common in kidney disease. Focus on fresh, homemade food and eat 
        only small amounts of restaurant food and packaged food, which usually have lots of sodium. Look for low sodium 
        (5% or less) on food labels. In a week or two, you'll get used to less salt in your food, especially if you dial
         up the flavor with herbs, spices, mustard, and flavored vinegars. But don't use salt substitutes unless your 
         doctor or dietitian says you can. Many are very high in potassium, which you may need to limit.

            Choose continuous activity such as walking, swimming, bicycling (indoors or out), skiing, aerobic dancing or
             any other activities in which you need to move large muscle groups continuously. Low-level strengthening
              exercises may also be beneficial as part of your program. Design your program to use low weights and high
               repetitions, and avoid heavy lifting.
