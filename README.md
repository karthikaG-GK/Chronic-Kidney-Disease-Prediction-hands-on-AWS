This project is done by my personal interest. This is an end to end project. Detailed pipeline is followed in this work..
1. DataSet gathering
2. Data Exploratory Analysis
3. Handling missing values
4. Feature selection
5. Encoding
6. Scaling
7. Dimension Reduction 
8. Train and Test split
9. Training the model
10. Testing the model
11. Deployment.
This is how my applications front page looks.
